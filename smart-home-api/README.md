# Smart Home API

Entity-Based Home Environment System API

The Home Environment System will manage houses, rooms, floors, and devices. The API needs to support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these entities, and support data retrieval for devices, rooms, halls, and houses.

# Data Formatting

Data for all entities will be stored in a JSON format as discussed in class. See the data structures for this API in `smart-home-data.json`
